# addition

Jehan P's Learning Journey project

This app tests the user's mental addition skill by giving them a target number. 
The user has to press numbered buttons that add up to the target number.

If the user reaches the target, the score increases.
If the user overshoots the target, the score decreases.

Each round has a countdown timer.
If the score goes below zero, or the countdown runs out, the game is over.
